The Odin Project : Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game was realized while
following The Odin Project's Foundation Course.

I am proud of this small game because it teached me how to deal with
2D and 3D arrays, I didn't even think that it would work, but it did.
I am happy.
